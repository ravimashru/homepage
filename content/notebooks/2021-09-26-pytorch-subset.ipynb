    "When training deep learning models, you'll often want to try out new ideas and see what effect it has on your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes very important to have a very high iteration speed. The faster you can train a model, the faster you can test different ideas and see how they impact the performance of the model.\n",

    "> The more experiments you can do, the better!   \n",

    "\n",
    "If your model takes too long to train, you can reduce the training time by either using a simpler model, or by using a smaller dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to reduce the size of a dataset is to use only a subset of the classes it contains. The [Imagenette](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) dataset is an example of this. It contains a subset of 10 classes from the larger [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset. Because it's smaller in size, it allows anyone to train state-of-the-art image classification models even if they don't have access to state-of-the-art computing resources, in a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this short post, we'll learn how to use the `Subset` class in PyTorch to use a small part of a larger dataset for training models quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method we will learn applies to any instance of a PyTorch dataset. For simplicity, let us assume we are interested in using the CIFAR10 dataset."
