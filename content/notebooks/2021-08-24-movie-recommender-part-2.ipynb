    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering systems like the movie recommender we are trying to create face the bootstrapping problem when one of two things occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **new user** signs up - which movies do we recommend to such a user?\n",
    "2. A **new movie** is added - to which users do we recommend the movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signup Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sites ask new users a set of questions when they sign up. This signup metadata can then be used with a model trained to predict the new user's embedding vector from this signup metadata. This vector can then be used to predict the rating the new user would give to movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average of All User Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option would be to use an average of all the existing user embedding vectors as the new user's embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this would probably give terrible recommendations in the beginning as it is unlikely that such an average would be close to representing any user in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pick \"Average User\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to pick an existing user to represent the \"average user\" and provide recommendations based on this user's embedding vector. This works only if you have a way to pick such an average user. Even then, not all new user's tastes would match with this average user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommending Movies to a New User\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a combination of some of the above approaches. We will follow a five-step process to recommend movies to a new user:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask the user to rate movies they have already seen\n",
    "2. Use the user's ratings to find top 5 similar users\n",
    "3. Assign the new user a vector that is the mean of these 5 users' vectors\n",
    "4. Use this calculated vector to predict how the new user would rate other movies\n",
    "5. Return the top 5 movies with the highest predicted rating as recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The more movies a user rates beforehand, the better the predictions will be. This wouldn't be ideal for a platform like Netflix because after users sign up, they wouldn't be too happy if they had to spend time rating movies they've watched instead of watching new ones. But for this toy project, this approach should be fine.\n",
